# mining-game
A simple, text-based game where you can mine and build.

### Legacy Build
If you go into the `legacy/` directory, you can see the
original, batch release of the game. Which has more
features as it is the base game.

### Universal Build
If you go into the `universal/` directory, you can see
the universal release, which is the python re-write of
the game's source code, where it is supposed to run on
every device that supports python, including your phone!
It is still missing some of the features of the legacy
release but it is slowly gaining features.
