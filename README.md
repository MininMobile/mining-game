# mining-game
A simple, text-based game where you can mine and build.

### Legacy Build
If you go into the `legacy/` directory, you can see the
original, batch release of the game. Which is the
original, pure, virgin release of the game.

### Universal Build
If you go into the `universal/` directory, you can see
the universal release, which is the python re-write of
the game's source code, where it is supposed to run on
every device that supports python, including your phone!
It has caught up with the original release of the game
and now is being built up to contain even MORE features
than the original!
